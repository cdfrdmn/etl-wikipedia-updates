# IDENTIFICATION
# The User-Agent is sent in the header of every web request. 
# Many APIs (like Wikipedia/MediaWiki) require a contact email so they can 
# reach out if your bot causes technical issues rather than just banning your IP.
user-agent: "ETLWiki-Bot (contact: your@email.com)"

# PERFORMANCE SETTINGS
# db-batch-size: How many records to process in a single database transaction.
# - Higher values: Faster total processing time but uses more memory.
# - Lower values: Safer for low-memory systems or unstable connections.
db-batch-size: 50

# STORAGE MANAGEMENT
# db-max-events: The maximum number of records allowed in the local database.
# Once this limit is reached, the bot will rotate data to prevent your disk
# from filling up. 
# 500,000 events occupies ~1 GB of storage.
db-max-events: 250000
